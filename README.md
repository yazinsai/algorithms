# Algorithms

Love 'em or hate 'em, most tech companies still require that you know 'em when you interview for any technical role. This is a repository of all of the practice questions that I worked on while interviewing at various companies (including Big 4's like Facebook and Google) for a Software Engineer / Product Manager role. Like you (most probably), I hadn't done much work on algorithms since college, so this took quite a bit of practice to get the hang of.

You can browse through the repository at your leisure, or you can follow this guide. The choice is yours.

## Question databases

I got most of these questions from:

- [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com)
- [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://a.co/12YqYUt)
- [99problems in Ruby](https://github.com/georgi/99problems)

## Study first

I went through the following study material in preparation for the interviews. In all, it took about 2 - 3 weeks of *full-time* studying to pass my first set of interviews. That's ~10 hours a day, for 2 weeks so about 140 hours total.

I studied from:
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://a.co/12YqYUt)
- [Algorithms divide and conquer course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer)
- [This great Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6278bi/my_journey_and_tips_29_gpa_at_a_noname_liberal/#bottom-comments), going through [the Study Guide](https://workflowy.com/s/wGqavcPQFm)
